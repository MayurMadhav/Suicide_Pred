# Introduction
In recent times, the increasing number of student suicides worldwide has highlighted a critical problem that demands our attention. This project, "Suicide Detection for Students using Student Forums," aims to leverage technology to address this pressing issue. By harnessing the power of natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, we seek to identify potential signs of emotional distress and suicidal tendencies within student forum discussions.

# Problem Statement <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72274851/222214323-923a3fe7-56e9-4ba0-abff-162681500702.png" width="60" height="60">

Student forums serve as platforms where students express their thoughts and challenges. Detecting signs of distress and potential suicide risk within these conversations is a complex task, often overwhelmed by the sheer volume and subtlety of cues.

# Solution <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72274851/222216353-58874ba5-d9cc-4298-baab-4255bbdb0193.png" width="60" height="60">
Our solution employs advanced NLP techniques to analyze the language used in student forum posts. This approach allows us to identify patterns indicating emotional turmoil, depression, or thoughts of self-harm, enabling early intervention and support.

# Objectives <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2800/2800015.png" width="60" height="60">
1. Early Detection: Promptly identify potential distress signals to enable timely intervention.
2. Privacy Focused: Our system analyzes language patterns while respecting user privacy.
3. Counselor Notification: Notify school counselors discreetly when concerning language is detected.
4. Support Ecosystem: Foster effective communication between students and counselors, creating a holistic support network.

# Impact
We believe that by combining technology with empathy, we can make a significant impact on students' lives. Early intervention and emotional support are crucial factors in preventing tragic outcomes. Our system is designed to enhance educators' and counselors' ability to reach out when students need it most.

# Project Overview
 
Using the power of OneAPI and Machine Learning, in our project we showcase how we can use student forums and conversation done on any microphone to detect if a student is prone to have intriguing thoughts of commiting suicide which is based on analysis of data recorded for past few days. We have also used Natural Language Processing (NLP) to add convenince to recording of data for analysis.

# Innovations & Unique Features <img src="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/3.15.23-scott-snyder-esg-corporate-innovation-GettyImages-1410816388.png" width="70" height="50">
Integrating suicide detection algorithm to a student forum and a microphone helps to record the data in a covenient manner rather than recording data explicitly such like a form (most of the users are reluctant about).

 
# Future Enhancements <img src="https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/projects/human-enhancement/human-enhancement.jpg?w=1000" width="60" height="60"> 
 The solution when integrated with NLP can be integrated in a mobile application for continous data recording and processing so that there will be continous detection. This methodology is already used by platforms like INSTAGRAM and FACEBOOK for target/niche advertising.
